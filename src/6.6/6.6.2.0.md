# Release notes Shopware 6.6.2.0

## Abstract



## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Typescript support for webpack config in extensions
Extension can now use typescript (.ts and .cts files) for their webpack configuration. 

### Added meteor component library to the administration

The [Meteor component library](https://shopware.design/meteor-components/) was added as a new dependecy to the administration.
All components from the library are now also directly available in the administration.

### Sync option for CLI theme commands

The `theme:compile` and `theme:change ` command now accept `--sync` option to compile themes synchronously. The `--sync` option is useful for CI/CD pipelines, when at runtime themes should be compiled async, but during the build process you want sync generation.

### Order Approval improvements

The order approval got a revamp with a new UI to create approval rules. Additional the approval rules can now be extended with custom rules. 
Lastly the payment authorization can now be automated with the Flow Builder.
